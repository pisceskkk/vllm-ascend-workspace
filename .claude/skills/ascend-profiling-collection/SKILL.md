name: ascend-profiling-collection
description: Collect one Ascend torch-profiler case end-to-end on a workspace-managed remote NPU container. Starts a profiled vLLM service, brackets a workload with /start_profile and /stop_profile, runs analyse(), verifies kernel_details.csv landed, and writes a manifest the analysis skill can consume. Use for requests like "采集 profiling", "torch profiler 跑一个 case", "采一份 profile 出来", "采 profiling 给我分析". Do not use for pure performance benchmarking, HBM/memory profiling, or for analysing already-collected profiling data (that is the analysis skill's job).
