description: Ensure a ready remote runtime runs the exact current local workspace state before any remote smoke, service launch, or benchmark. Use automatically immediately before remote execution when direct local -> container SSH already works and local uncommitted changes must be reflected remotely. Do not use for initial machine attach, generic Git topology work, or unrelated local-only coding.
