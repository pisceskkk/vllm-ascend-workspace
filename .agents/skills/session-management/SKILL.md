description: Create, list, inspect, remove, garbage-collect, and group isolated VAWS agent sessions, and optionally coordinate NPU task intent across independent agents on one host. Use before remote execution when tasks must not share worktrees, containers, serving state, or resource leases, when cooperative NPU queueing is requested, or when one distributed scenario needs an ordered set of existing sessions. Do not use for service lifecycle, code sync, benchmarks, or distributed failure diagnosis.

# Session Management

When `.vaws-local/workspace-identity.json` contains a unified alias, new
session container names inherit the base machine namespace. Session records
also snapshot `agent_id` and alias for cooperative attribution. Existing
session/container names are never rewritten after an alias change.

Create and maintain isolated VAWS sessions for parallel agent work.

Each session binds:

- one local Git worktree
- one remote session container
- one `.vaws-local/sessions/<session-id>/` state namespace
- local leases for container SSH port, service port, and optional NPU devices

A session group binds two or more ready sessions with the same code and
submodule snapshot, plus explicit startup and reverse shutdown order. Grouping
does not create another container or duplicate member leases.

## Use This Skill When

- a user wants multiple agents/tasks to run in parallel
- a remote execution task should avoid interfering with another service or benchmark
- a task needs a dedicated worktree plus dedicated remote runtime/container
- you need to list, inspect, remove, or clean up existing sessions

## Critical Rules

- Invoke SSH-backed session create/status/remove/GC/group/coordinator workflows
  outside the Codex filesystem sandbox from their first call, using a narrow
  approval for the concrete entrypoint. The full workflow, not only `ssh -G`,
  must remain in the host execution plane.
- Treat `ssh_host_execution_required` as an instruction to rerun the same
  public wrapper outside the sandbox, never as permission to alter `/etc/ssh`.
- Prefer `--session-id`, `VAWS_SESSION_ID`, or `VAWS_AGENT_SESSION_ID` when an upstream agent already has a stable id.
- `session_create.py` creates a fresh generated id when no explicit/env id is provided; it does not reuse `.vaws-local/current-session.json` as a creation default.
- Existing-session lookup commands may use `.vaws-local/current-session.json` as a convenience fallback.
- Do not reuse the base machine container for new parallel tasks. New tasks should use `session_create.py`.
- For NPU work, reserve devices during creation with `--devices` or `--npu-count`; session-aware serving uses that lease by default.
- For session work, pass `--session-id <id>` or `--session-file <session.json>` to parity, serving, benchmark, profiling-collection, memory-profiling, and profiling-analysis entry points.
- Never call legacy `serve_stop.py --machine <alias>` from a session-scoped task.
- Session removal should stop only that session's service and release only that session's leases.
- Shared NPU coordination is an optional gentleman's agreement. It must not become a mandatory gate for existing serving, benchmark, profiling, or remote-command flows.
- Shared coordination state is intentionally ephemeral under the remote host's `/tmp`; if it disappears, start a new coordination epoch and trust actual host occupancy over missing declarations.

## Entry Points

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/session-management/scripts/session_create.py \
  --machine <alias-or-ip> \
  [--session-id <id>] \
  [--base-ref main] \
  [--branch session/<id>] \
  [--devices 0,1] \
  [--npu-count 2] \
  [--verification-mode ssh|full] \
  [--disable-prepared-image-cache]
```

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/session-management/scripts/session_list.py
python3 .agents/skills/session-management/scripts/session_status.py --session-id <id>
python3 .agents/skills/session-management/scripts/session_remove.py --session-id <id> --remove-container --remove-worktree --release-leases
python3 .agents/skills/session-management/scripts/session_gc.py
```

Optional cross-agent NPU coordination on the same bare-metal host:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/session-management/scripts/npu_coordination.py \
  --machine <alias-or-ip> submit \
  --task-id <id> --npu-count 2 \
  --estimated-duration-seconds 1800

python3 .agents/skills/session-management/scripts/npu_coordination.py \
  --machine <alias-or-ip> acquire --task-id <id>
```

The coordinator uses `/tmp/vaws-npu-coordinator/v1/coordinator.sqlite3` on the
bare-metal host. It is advisory, does not alter existing local Session leases,
and never stops an observed external or human process. It automatically
publishes the persistent workspace UUID plus configured agent alias;
`--agent-id` and `--agent-alias` remain explicit overrides.

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/session-management/scripts/session_group.py create \
  --group-id <id> \
  --member <name>=<session-id> \
  --member <name>=<session-id> \
  [--startup-order <name,name,...>]

python3 .agents/skills/session-management/scripts/session_group.py status --group-id <id>
python3 .agents/skills/session-management/scripts/session_group.py list
python3 .agents/skills/session-management/scripts/session_group.py teardown \
  --group-id <id> \
  [--remove-containers] [--remove-worktrees] [--release-leases] [--force]
```

Progress is emitted on `stderr` as `__VAWS_SESSION_PROGRESS__=<json>`. Final output is JSON on `stdout`.

By default session creation uses a host-local prepared image cache keyed by the selected base image id. The first session for a base image may still install container SSH packages, then commits `vaws-session-prepared:<image-hash>-ssh-v2`; later sessions start from that prepared image and skip the repeated `openssh` package install and cached pip/pytest bootstrap. Use `--disable-prepared-image-cache` only when validating raw base-image bootstrap behavior.

Session creation defaults to `--verification-mode ssh`: it verifies host SSH and direct session-container SSH, then leaves NPU runtime proof to the task that actually uses the session, such as serving, benchmark, or profiling. Use `--verification-mode full` when validating a raw machine/container bootstrap and you need the extra `torch` / `torch_npu` smoke check during creation.

## State

Local untracked state lives under `.vaws-local/sessions/`:

- `index.json`
- `leases.json`
- `locks/`
- `<session-id>/session.json`
- `<session-id>/serving.json`
- `<session-id>/benchmark/`
- `groups/<group-id>/group.json`

Worktree bindings are written to `<worktree>/.vaws-local/current-session.json` and include the absolute base session file path so scripts run from the worktree can find the base session state.

For explicit `--session-id --no-worktree` timing/debug sessions, `session_create.py` does not overwrite the repo-root `.vaws-local/current-session.json`; agents should pass `--session-id` or `--session-file` explicitly for those shared-root flows. Current-session binding writes are atomic so readers never observe partial JSON.
