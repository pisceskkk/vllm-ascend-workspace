name: vllm-ascend-change-validation
description: Analyze vLLM and vllm-ascend diffs, map affected components to the minimum sufficient correctness, build, performance, graph, operator, distributed, and profiling evidence, link downstream Run Manifest results, and produce a PR-ready validation report. Use for PR validation, workspace-diff risk analysis, deciding what tests a change requires, or documenting untested combinations. Do not use as a replacement for the downstream execution skills or for a change with no accessible diff.

# vLLM Ascend Change Validation

Use this Skill as the validation planner and evidence aggregator for a code change.

## Workflow

1. Obtain the exact baseline and candidate diff, including relevant untracked files.
2. Run `scripts/change_validation.py plan`.
3. Review `impact-analysis.json` and `validation-plan.json`; correct false-positive or missing mappings before consuming NPU resources.
4. Execute required items with the owning Skill:
   - correctness evidence: `vllm-ascend-correctness-validation`;
   - eager-pass/graph-fail diagnosis: `vllm-ascend-graph-debug`;
   - service lifecycle: `vllm-ascend-serving`;
   - benchmark and profiling evidence: their dedicated Skills;
   - distributed, operator, or performance workflows when those Skills are available.
5. Link each downstream Run Manifest with the plan item IDs it covers.
6. Run `finalize`.
7. Deliver `pr-validation-report.md` with explicit missing and recommended coverage.

The planner reads `.agents/knowledge/validation-rules.yaml`. Missing rules produce a generic targeted smoke plus manual-review flag; they never imply that no validation is needed.

## Entry point

`scripts/change_validation.py` provides:

- `plan`: collect or read a unified diff, classify impact, write a validation plan, and create a parent Run Manifest;
- `link`: associate a downstream Run Manifest with one or more plan items;
- `finalize`: assess required coverage and child statuses, then generate the final PR report.

Read:

- [Behavior contract](references/behavior.md) for diff, rule, plan, link, and final-status semantics.
- [Command recipes](references/command-recipes.md) for worktree, commit-range, and imported-diff examples.
- [Acceptance](references/acceptance.md) before claiming the change is validated.

## Rules

- Keep the reason and source rule for every plan item.
- Distinguish `required` and `recommended`; resource constraints do not silently downgrade required evidence.
- Treat child `failed` as failed, child non-terminal/inconclusive or missing required coverage as inconclusive.
- A passed parent requires every required item to be covered by at least one passed child run.
- Record unsupported, unknown, and intentionally omitted combinations under known limitations.
- Do not duplicate Serving, correctness, Benchmark, Profiling, graph-debug, distributed-debug, or operator-debug implementation.
- Keep run state under `.vaws-local/change-validation/`.
